# Report

# Description 
 This project is devoloped for calculating the resistance of resistors using there colour code, where user will be asked for entering the colour code as visible on the resistor correctly which will be used to calculate and displayed.
 
 # Identifying features
1. The solution should be capable enough to be used for both 4 band colour code as well as 5 band colour code.
2. The user will be given the choice of selecting the type of resistor colour coding.
3. The output will be displayed in ohms which will be convinient to the user.

# Learnings from the project
1. Learned to use GitHub for storing sharing and evolving the Project content and code.
2. Learned about different aspects of programming like Multifile programming and backend processing.
3. Learned about the execution of files in Linux operating system using different commands.
4. Learned to generate Makefile in lunux.
5. Learned about Unite testing, manual testing and about the efficient way to write a programs.
6. Learned about the process followed in the industry for solving of a problem.
7. Learned about Product development lifecyle and applied it during this project to arrive at a fissible solution.
