# Description 
 This project is devoloped for calculating the resistance of resistors using there colour code, where user will be asked for entering the colour code as visible on the resistor correctly which will be used to calculate and displayed.
 
 # Identifying features
1. The solution should be capable enough to be used for both 4 band colour code as well as 5 band colour code.
2. The user will be given the choice of selecting the type of resistor colour coding.
3. The output will be displayed in ohms which will be convinient to the user.
