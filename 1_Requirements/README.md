# Description 
 This project is devoloped for calculating the resistance of resistors using there colour code, where user will be asked for entering the colour code as visible on the resistor correctly which will be used to calculate and displayed.

# Requirements

## High Level Requirements
 Features of my projects
 1. Entering input regarding the colour code as present on the resistor by user .
 2. Performing certain operations for calculating the value of resistor.
 3. Printing the value of resistor.



## Low Level Requirements
 How each feature is implemented 
1.  Printing of the statment to the user, asking for the input regarding the type of colour code pressent on the resistor.
2.  Entering input about the type of colour code present on the resistor by user (4 colour code band / 5 colour code band ).
3.  Printing the instruction about how to enter the colour code as an input.
4.  Printing the statment to the user, asking for the input regarding the colour code of resistor
5.  Entering of input by the user regarding the colour code of resistor.
6.  Saving the received input.
7.  Deciding upon the different operations to be performed based on the input received.
8.  Performing different calculation based on the operations to be performed.
9. Storing the result of operations.
10. Printing the result of the operation i.e. the value of resistor.
