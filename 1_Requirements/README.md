# Description 
 This project is devoloped for calculating the resistance of resistors using there colour code, where user will be asked for entering the colour code as visible on the resistor correctly which will be used to calculate and displayed.
 
 # Identifying features
1. The solution should be capable enough to be used for both 4 band colour code as well as 5 band colour code.
2. The user will be given the choice of selecting the type of resistor colour coding.
3. The output will be displayed in ohms which will be convinient to the user.

  # Literature Survey
  There are many different types of Resistor available which can be used in both electrical and electronic circuits to control the flow of current or to produce a voltage drop in   many different ways. But in order to do this the actual resistor needs to have some form of “resistive” or “resistance” value. Resistors are available in a range of different   resistance values from fractions of an Ohm ( Ω ) to millions of Ohms.
   small resistors use coloured painted bands to indicate both their resistive value and their tolerance with the physical size of the resistor indicating its wattage rating. These coloured painted bands produce a system of identification generally known as a Resistors Colour Code.
   The resistor colour code markings are always read one band at a time starting from the left to the right, with the larger width tolerance band oriented to the right side indicating its tolerance. By matching the colour of the first band with its associated number in the digit column of the colour chart below the first digit is identified and this represents the first digit of the resistance value.
Again, by matching the colour of the second band with its associated number in the digit column of the colour chart we get the second digit of the resistance value and so on. Then the resistor colour code is read from left to right as illustrated below:
